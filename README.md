# Mood
A data analysis project consisting of an analysis script that maps data consisting of 5 features to a 2 dimensional plane using PCA (principal component analysis) to determine which directions explain the most varibility in the data. 

The script then colors the projected data according to the response variable, the mood rating, and adds vectors associated to an increase in each old feature. The goal is to read questionnaire data from a person over a period of a few weeks and to try to determine the most important factors that influence the mood.
